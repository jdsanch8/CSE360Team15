----Game Explanation----
You’re in a race against time with a limited supply of food. Prevent your people from dying
of hunger by ultimately building a farm to save the town.

----Rules----
The object of the game is to build a farm using the resources you have each turn before losing
all your food. Each turn the dice will be rolled to determine whether you will receive more
resources or experience famine from a thief or disaster by removing resources. Three food is
spent every time you roll the dice.  In order to build a farm, 3 prerequisite buildings must
be erected first. One of each required structure includes: a house, fence, and well. There are
2 optional structures the mill and mine which give additional bonuses. Each building has a unique
cost, and when built, offers a benefit to your turn as shown below.

Required Buildings:
House - Increases the potential maximum amount of wood or stone received per turn from 4 to 6
cost - stone:5 wood:5

Fence - Decreases the thief’s chance of stealing wood, stone, or food
cost - stone:2 wood:5

Well - Reduces the amount of food lost per turn from 3 to 2
cost - stone:5 wood:2

Optional Buildings:
Mill - Gives a chance to increase the amount of wood you receive
cost - stone:5

Mine - Gives a chance to increase the amount of stone you receive
cost - wood:5

Winning Building:
Farm - Final structure
cost - stone:3 wood:3 food:3

Winning the game:
Once a farm has been successfully built, you have won the game.

Losing the game:
If a farm cannot be made by the time your food has run out, you have lost.

---Statistics---
*victory (yes or no)
*days
*buildings
*resources
*alphabetical order
The most important statistic used for ranking is victory (i.e., did the player win or lose?).
If multiple players all won (or all lost) the next category looked at for ranking is days. For a win,
a higher ranking would complete the game in less days.  For a loss, a higher ranking would survive longer -- 
i.e., would have more days. If victory and days are the same, the next category for ranking is buildings made.  If all
three statistics are the same, the next statistic for ranking is resources.  Lastly, if all
categories are the same, the ranking is sorted alphabetically by the player's name.
